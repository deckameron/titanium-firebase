# Firebase in Appcelerator Titanium
This project will contain all Firebase-related modules for Analytics, Cloud-Messaging, Authentication, Firestore etc.

## Requirements

- [x] Android: Titanium SDK **7.0.0+** and [Ti.PlayServices](https://github.com/appcelerator-modules/ti.playservices)

## Demo

⏩ [hansemannn/titanium-firebase-demo](https://github.com/hansemannn/titanium-firebase-demo)

## Installation

1. Download the core-module [titanium-firebase-core](https://github.com/hansemannn/titanium-firebase-core/releases)
2. Download the desired feature-module(s) from the below list
3. Unpack them to your project directory
4. Configure your Firebase project
 - iOS: Download the `GoogleService-Info.plist` from your project and copy it to `Resources` (classic) or `app/assets/iphone` (Alloy)
 - Android: Download the `google-services.json` and copy it to `Resources` (classic) or `app/assets/android` (Alloy)
5. Require the your modules and call the `configure` method to configure your Firebase application:
```js
var FirebaseCore = require('firebase.core');
FirebaseCore.configure();
```
6. You are good to go!

## ⚠️ Android Notes
If this module is used together with other modules that use the Google Play Services (e.g. Ti.Map or Ti.Admob)
you have to use at least Titanium SDK 7.0.0 for Android which resolves duplicate dependencies for you. 

Latest module versions that support 7.0.0 and have Ti.PlayServices included:
  - [Ti.Map 4.0.0](https://github.com/appcelerator-modules/ti.map/releases/tag/android-4.0.0)
  - [Ti.Admob 4.0.0](https://github.com/appcelerator-modules/ti.admob/releases/tag/android-4.0.0)
  
You are not using 7.0.0 because of modules that are not updated so far? Update open source modules quickly by using
the [Android 64-Bit Migration Guide](http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#!/guide/Android_Module_Upgrade_Guide).

## Features
The list of supported features will be updated once a new feature is added to the list. 
Feel free to take over a new feature by creating the module and making a pull-request to update this readme.
